# Bookery

**Bookery** is a cozy, community-focused platform where book lovers—especially introverts—can connect, swap books, attend or host calm reading events, and share literary discoveries. The goal is to keep things warm, accessible, and low-pressure, appealing to those who prefer a gentle environment for exploring and discussing books.

**Open Source**:
We aim to keep Bookery open source to encourage community-driven development. Everyone can contribute ideas, code, and features, shaping a supportive, reader-friendly community that celebrates the joy of reading.
